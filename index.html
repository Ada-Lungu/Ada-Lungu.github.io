       <p>"Omul, cat traieste, tot invatza" sais a romanian proverb. One keeps learning while he is alive. LED is a community of people that believe that life is a constant adventure in which we learn in formal and non-formal ways. We think that we, as individuals, we need to grow and expand our knowledge and domains of expertise continually.</p>

At the global level, Article 13 of the United Nations' 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognises the right of everyone to an education.[2] Although education is compulsory in most places up to a certain age, attendance at school often isn't, and a minority of parents choose home-schooling, e-learning or similar for their children.
